## Overview

This toolkit provides four main scripts to help optimize your older Ubuntu system's performance:

- **üöÄ All-in-One Optimizer** - Automated benchmark ‚Üí optimize ‚Üí compare workflow with MD report
- **üìä Performance Benchmark** - Capture baseline metrics before/after optimization
- **‚ö° System Optimizer** - Apply safe performance optimizations with confirmations
- **üîÑ Revert Optimizations** - Safely undo all changes with backup restoration

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Safe & Reversible** - All changes are backed up and can be undone
- ‚úÖ **Interactive** - Confirmation prompts for each optimization step
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive** - CPU, memory, storage, and graphics optimizations
- ‚úÖ **Well-Tested** - Designed for older Ubuntu systems and laptops (2015-2018 era)
- ‚úÖ **Documented** - Clear progress reporting and error handling

## Quick Start

### Option 1: All-in-One (Recommended)

1. **Clone and run the automated workflow:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ubuntu-vintage-optimizer.git
   cd ubuntu-vintage-optimizer
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ./scripts/optimize_and_compare.sh
   ```
   This will automatically:
   - Run baseline benchmark
   - Apply optimizations (with confirmations)
   - Run post-optimization benchmark  
   - Generate detailed Markdown comparison report

### Option 2: Manual Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ubuntu-vintage-optimizer.git
   cd ubuntu-vintage-optimizer
   ```

2. **Make scripts executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. **Capture baseline performance:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/performance_benchmark.sh
   ```

4. **Run optimizations:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/optimize_laptop.sh
   ```

5. **Benchmark again to see improvements:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/performance_benchmark.sh
   ```

## What Gets Optimized

### System-Level Optimizations
- **SSD TRIM Service** - Enables automatic SSD maintenance
- **Memory Swappiness** - Reduces swap usage (ideal for 16GB+ RAM)
- **CPU Governor** - Sets performance mode for better responsiveness
- **Intel GPU** - Enables hardware acceleration features

### Software Optimizations
- **Intel Media Driver** - Hardware video acceleration
- **Firefox Guidance** - Manual steps for browser optimization

## Supported Hardware

**Tested On:**
- Dell Latitude series (E7450, E7470, etc.)
- Lenovo ThinkPad series (T460, T470, etc.)
- Intel 6th generation CPUs (Skylake) and newer
- 16GB+ RAM configurations
- Intel HD Graphics 520/530

**Should Work On:**
- Most laptops from 2015-2018 era
- Intel integrated graphics systems
- Ubuntu 18.04+ and derivative distributions

## Prerequisites

- Linux system (Ubuntu/Debian preferred)
- sudo access
- 100MB free disk space for backups

## Usage Examples

### All-in-One Workflow (Recommended)
```bash
# Complete optimization workflow with report
./scripts/optimize_and_compare.sh

# This will:
# 1. Run baseline benchmark
# 2. Apply optimizations (with prompts)
# 3. Run post-optimization benchmark
# 4. Generate detailed Markdown report
# 
# Reports saved to: ~/.laptop_reports/
# Raw benchmarks: ~/.laptop_benchmarks/
```

### Manual Usage
```bash
# Run all optimizations with prompts
./scripts/optimize_laptop.sh

# Revert all changes
./scripts/revert_optimizations.sh
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Before optimization
./scripts/performance_benchmark.sh

# Apply optimizations
./scripts/optimize_laptop.sh

# After optimization  
./scripts/performance_benchmark.sh

# Compare results in ~/.laptop_benchmarks/
```

### Selective Optimization
The optimizer will ask for confirmation at each step:
- ‚úÖ Enable TRIM service
- ‚ùå Skip CPU governor changes
- ‚úÖ Install Intel media driver
- etc.

## Safety Features

- **Automatic Backups** - All modified files are backed up with timestamps
- **Disk Space Checks** - Ensures sufficient space before operations
- **Validation** - Verifies changes were applied correctly
- **Error Handling** - Graceful failure recovery
- **Dependency Checks** - Warns about package dependencies before removal

## File Locations

- **Backups:** `~/.laptop_optimization_backups/`
- **Benchmarks:** `~/.laptop_benchmarks/`
- **Reports:** `~/.laptop_reports/` (Markdown comparison reports)
- **System Files Modified:**
  - `/etc/sysctl.conf` (swappiness)
  - `/etc/default/grub` (GPU parameters)
  - `/etc/systemd/system/cpu-performance.service` (CPU governor)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Script fails with permission denied**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

**Q: GRUB update fails**
- Script automatically restores backup on GRUB failure
- Reboot to previous kernel if needed

**Q: Performance didn't improve**
- Check if reboot is required (GPU optimizations)
- Verify optimizations were applied with benchmark script
- See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed guidance

### Getting Help

1. Check the [docs/](docs/) directory for detailed guides
2. Review benchmark output in `~/.laptop_benchmarks/`
3. Open an issue with system details and error messages
